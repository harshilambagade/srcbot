// Package slack allows integration with the Slack Real Time Messaging API (https://api.slack.com/rtm)
// for consuming and publishing messages in real time to/from Slack (https://slack.com).
//
// To make use of the API, you will need to setup a user account or a 'bot' user
// (https://api.slack.com/bot-users) (a special kind of user account specifically designed for
// programatic access to APIs) and obtain an authentication token (https://api.slack.com/web#basics)
// from Slack.
